      "concurrentrequestthreshold": "Request Timeout Threshold for Concurrent Requests",
      "concurrentrequestthresholdDesc": "This setting enables you to specify a threshold for the number of concurrent requests that Lucee can handle before beginning to enforce request timeouts. By adjusting this threshold, you can fine-tune how Lucee manages request timeouts under varying loads. A higher threshold allows more concurrent requests to be processed without enforcing timeouts, potentially improving performance under heavy load at the risk of longer request times. The default threshold is set to 0, meaning request timeouts are enforced immediately for all requests. This setting is only possible via System Property / Enviroment Variable.",
      "cputhreshold": "CPU Usage Threshold for Request Timeouts",
      "cputhresholdDesc": "This configuration option allows you to set a CPU usage threshold that Lucee monitors before enforcing request timeouts. The threshold value is a float ranging from 0.0 (representing 0% CPU usage) to 1.0 (indicating 100% CPU usage). When the system's CPU usage is below this threshold, Lucee processes requests without applying the request timeout rule, enabling smoother handling under varying system loads. This mechanism is particularly useful for managing resource allocation and maintaining optimal application responsiveness, especially during periods of high demand or limited system resources. The default setting is 0.0, which means request timeouts are applied regardless of CPU usage. Adjusting this threshold provides a strategic lever to balance between system performance and request responsiveness, tailoring Lucee's behavior to your specific operational needs. This setting is only possible via System Property / Enviroment Variable.",
      "memorythreshold": "Memory Usage Threshold for Request Timeouts",
      "memorythresholdDesc": "This setting permits the establishment of a memory usage threshold, guiding Lucee on when to begin enforcing request timeouts based on the system's current memory consumption. The threshold value is a float from 0.0 (indicating 0% memory usage) to 1.0 (representing 100% memory usage). By monitoring memory usage against this threshold, Lucee intelligently decides whether to enforce or relax request timeouts, offering a dynamic approach to resource management. This is particularly advantageous for preventing system overloads and ensuring stable performance by not strictly applying timeouts when memory usage is below the defined threshold. The default threshold is set to 0.0, meaning Lucee will apply request timeouts without considering memory usage. Adjusting this threshold allows for more nuanced control over how your applications respond under various memory load conditions, optimizing both performance and reliability.
