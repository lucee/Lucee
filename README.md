## Lucee Server

Lucee Server (or simply Lucee) is a dynamic, Java based, tag and scripting language used for rapid web application development.   

Lucee simplifies technologies like webservices (REST, SOAP, HTTP), ORM (Hibernate), searching (Lucene), datasources (MSSQl, Oracle, MySQL and others), caching (infinispan, ehcache, and memcached) and many more. 

Lucee provides a compatibility layer for Adobe ColdFusion &copy;  CFML using less resources and delivering better performance. 

## Installation

You can [build Lucee from source](http://docs.lucee.org/guides/working-with-source.html) or grab one of our distributions:

- [Lucee Express](http://lucee.org/downloads.html) (just unzip and run; delete to clean up)
- [Installers for Windows, Linux and OSX](http://lucee.org/downloads.html)
- [Official Dockerfiles and Docker images](https://github.com/lucee/lucee-dockerfiles)

Alternatively try the super-useful [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) standalone developer tools for CFML powered by Lucee.

## Getting Help Easy

If you are [looking for commercial support](http://lucee.org/members.html), you might try one of the LAS Members.

## System Requirements

Lucee is a JVM language running as a servlet on just about any servlet container; including [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), [Eclipse Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty/), [JBoss AS](http://jbossas.jboss.org/), and [GlassFish](https://glassfish.java.net/).

_We stadardise on Apache Tomcat for installers and Docker containers as there is only so much time in the day._

## Philosophy

The Lucee team â€œtreats slowness as a bug". Many performance tests have shown Lucee to perform faster than other CFML engines. 

Lucee attempts to resolve many inconsistencies found in traditional CFML; either forcing changes in language behavior, or providing configurable options in the Lucee Administrator.

For more peruse the [Lucee Manifesto](http://lang.lucee.org/t/lucee-manifesto/183).

The Lucee team is always open to feedback and active at CFML community events, and is keen to remind people that Lucee is a community project.
